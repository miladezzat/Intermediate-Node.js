# Session 0: Introduction
Welcome to the Node.js course! In this course, we will learn how to use Node.js to build powerful and scalable applications.

Node.js is a popular runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js is widely used for building server-side applications, command-line tools, and even desktop applications.

In this course, we will cover the following topics:

1. Node.js modules
2. Node Package Manager (NPM)
3. Creating a web server
4. Working with the file system
5. Debugging Node.js applications
6. Event-driven programming
7. MongoDB and Mongoose
8. Express.js framework
9. Serving static resources
10. Authentication and authorization
11. Database connectivity
12. Project development

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to use Node.js to build complex and robust applications.

Before we get started, it is important to note that this course assumes a basic knowledge of JavaScript. We will be using JavaScript to write server-side code, and we will assume that you are familiar with the basics of the language, such as variables, functions, arrays, and objects.

Let's start with a simple example to get a feel for Node.js. Create a new file called "app.js" and enter the following code:
```js
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});

```

This code creates a basic HTTP server that listens on port 3000 and returns a "Hello World" message when a request is made to it. To run this code, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory containing the "app.js" file, and type "node app.js". Then, open a web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:3000" to see the message.

In the next session, we will cover Node.js modules and how to use them to organize and share code between files.
