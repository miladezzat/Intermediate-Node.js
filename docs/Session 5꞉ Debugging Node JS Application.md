# Session 5: Debugging Node JS Application

Debugging is a critical aspect of any programming language, and Node.js is no exception. With Node.js, you can debug your code using the built-in debugger, which allows you to step through your code and find and fix issues.

In this session, you'll learn how to use the core Node.js debugger to debug your Node.js applications.

## Debugging a Node.js Application
To start debugging a Node.js application, you need to add the --inspect flag when starting the application. This will start the application in debugging mode and enable remote debugging.

```js
node --inspect yourapp.js
```

You can also use the following command to start the debugger and pause on the first line of your code:

```js
node --inspect-brk yourapp.js
```
Once your application is running in debugging mode, you can use the Chrome DevTools to debug your application. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to chrome://inspect.

From here, you can see all of your running Node.js applications and connect to them for debugging. You can set breakpoints, step through your code, inspect variables, and more.


## Debugging in Visual Studio Code
You can also debug your Node.js application in Visual Studio Code. First, you need to install the `vscode` package:

```js
npm install --save-dev vscode
```

Then, you can create a `launch.json` file in your project directory with the following configuration:

```js
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug Node.js Application",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/yourapp.js",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "runtimeExecutable": "node",
      "port": 9229
    }
  ]
}
```

With this configuration, you can start debugging your Node.js application by pressing F5 or using the Debug panel in Visual Studio Code.

Conclusion
Debugging is an essential skill for any developer, and being able to debug your Node.js applications is critical to ensuring their reliability and stability. With the core Node.js debugger and tools like Visual Studio Code, you have everything you need to debug your Node.js applications effectively.
